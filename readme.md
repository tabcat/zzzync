ZZZYNC IS BEING REDESIGNED INTO A LIBP2P PROTOCOL HANDLER

FOLLOW PROGRESS HERE:

https://github.com/tabcat/zzzync/issues/38

---

This work was originally funded as part of a [grant](https://github.com/tabcat/rough-opal) by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai)

<!-- # ts-template-pnpm

## Usage

`pnpm run setup`

The script source is at ./setup.js and will move `workflows` into `.github/workflows` and then install the devDeps.

### Add NPM_TOKEN to github secrets

For the publish workflow to work, you need to add your NPM token as a secret to the repository.

### Enable Github Pages for Docs

`Repo Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Github Actions`

This will let the pages workflow complete.

> Done! -->
