# ðŸ’¤ync 
> sync with offline orbitdb peers using web3.storage and w3name

Currently, to replicate a database another orbitdb peer must be online. Using IPFS and IPNS pinning services we provide a new replicator. Stay synced with offline orbitdb peers using web3.storage and w3name!

run demo:
```
npm install
API_TOKEN=<your web3.storage api token here>
API_TOKEN=$API_TOKEN node demo.js
```
